Shane has been involved at the Apache Software Foundation since 1999, and serves as Director and VP of Brand Management, setting [policy for trademarks and branding](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources) and working with all 200+ Apache projects on community management, trademarks, and branding issues.

Otherwise, Shane is: a father and husband, a friend, a geek, a [Member of the ASF](http://whyilovetheasf.com/), a baker, a BMW driver, a punny guy, and lifelong resident within the 495 belt. Oh, and [we have cats](https://www.instagram.com/shanecurcuru/).  Shane regularly blogs and speaks on [open source community](http://communityovercode.com/), governance, and branding topics, and runs the [Punderthings consultancy](http://punderthings.com/).

This website showcases some of the open source presentations I've made at major conferences, including ApacheCon, OSCON, All Things Open, Community Leadership Summit, and Ignite.
