# Slides About The Apache Way

Shane's links to useful slide decks about The Apache Way.

Note that in the past, these talks were often an overview of history 
and how the ASF is organized, along with touching on the behavioral 
and community aspects of the Apache Way.

Key Aspects:

- Roles & progression
- Act as individuals "The fact that you’re a manager or an architect or a founder here doesn’t mean anything in Apache"
- etc.

**Crazy idea** interactive presentation: ask for feedback as to paths through preso; ask leading questions then present answer.

Short but powerfuls (when presented) deck about Hortonworks' internal employee training in Apache Way.

"Apache has ways to train new community members and new communities - e.g. the Incubator"

Internal one-hour training session; start with dev/prod mgmt but roll out throughout company

Apache Way; license; why company chose to work this way;
how to be employee & committer both; trademarks

# The Apache Way - Amalgamation
## Daniel Ruggeri - 2015 UMiss TheApacheWay-Amalgamation2015.odp
http://people.apache.org/~druggeri/presentations/TheApacheWay.odp

- Starts with history
- Clear steps through all other common themes of past presos
- "The board runs the foundation, not the projects"
- "The code is owned by the foundation" (but: really just licensed)
- "Community agrees on direction - (but) Individuals then make it happen"
- "Pragmatic and permissive - Maximum freedom for users"

Final slide:
The Apache way is.....
Meritocracy – those who do, decide
Participation – by individuals with peer review
Oversight – responsible and independent
Decisions – made by consensus
Collaboration – public and asynchronous

- PMCS are separate merit structures
- Voting, techniques, define terms (was still early then)
