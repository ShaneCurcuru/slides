# Slides About The Apache Way

Here are some useful slide decks about The Apache Way.  These have 
been presented by some amazing Apache committers and Members at 
ApacheCon and a variety of other opensource conferences in the past 
15 years.  This is a curated selection of posted slide decks.

Note that in the past, these talks were often an overview of history 
and how the ASF is organized, along with touching on the behavioral 
and community aspects of the Apache Way.  For a time, they were a common 
main track presentation at the start of ApacheCon in various places.

The Apache Way slot at ApacheCon morphed over time into the "State of the Feather",
which is now given by an officer of the ASF, and is more of a snapshot about 
the health of the ASF as an organization - not just it's component projects,
but the corporation and operations that keep the servers running and 
the press releases and tweets and events coming too.

So, too, morphs the Apahe Way talk of today, focusing much more on the 
behaviors and practices that are core to running a successful and 
diverse community-led project.

- Roles & progression
- Act as individuals "The fact that you’re a manager or an architect or a founder here doesn’t mean anything in Apache"
- etc.

# Inner Source And The Apache WAy 
## JimJag 2017 other conference ics-ebu2017-170419114857.pdf
https://www.slideshare.net/jimjag/innersource-101-and-the-apache-way

This is an advanced talk using the aspects of the Apache Way to lead 
corporate developers and managers how to use InnerSource - taking 
open source / open development concepts for use inside the firewall and 
inside corporate development teams.

### Top Aspects Covered

- Meritocracy
- Peer-based
- Consensus decision making 
- Collaborative development 
- Responsible oversight
- Individual participation

### Quotable Bits

- Focus on community
- Focus on the un-aligned volunteer contributor

- Since we are all volunteers, people’s time and interests change
- A healthy community is “warm and inviting” and encourages a continued influx of developers
- Poisonous people/communities turn people off, and the project will die

- Open and asynchronous
- Doesn’t disenfranchise anyone
- Maintains history and allows ebb/flow of participants

- Transparency: You can only reuse what you can **see**

- Communities can create durable assets, processes and culture

- Merit: Technical decisions made by technical experts, with **Earned** Authority

- A Community is not the same as a team: 
  - self organizing
  - self identifying 


# The Apache Way - Amalgamation
## Daniel Ruggeri - 2015 UMiss TheApacheWay-Amalgamation2015.odp
http://people.apache.org/~druggeri/presentations/TheApacheWay.odp

This is a new Apache Member's amalgamation of many past Apache Way 
slide decks, covering all the points in a detailed yet condensed way.

### Quotable Bits

- Clear steps through all other common themes of past presos
- "The board runs the foundation, not the projects"
- "The code is owned by the foundation" (but: really just licensed)
- "Community agrees on direction - (but) Individuals then make it happen"
- "Pragmatic and permissive - Maximum freedom for users"

### Final slide

The Apache way is.....
Meritocracy – those who do, decide
Participation – by individuals with peer review
Oversight – responsible and independent
Decisions – made by consensus
Collaboration – public and asynchronous

http://home.apache.org/~nick/Talks/ApacheConNA15/TheApacheWay15.pdf

This is a modern version of the early classic Apache Way talks, that 
emphasizes all the past people who helped create the way.

### Top Aspects Covered

- History lesson
- Apache by the numbers & graphs
- Structure/governance of the ASF and projects
- Example: Jakarta & Umbrellas -> flattened, each project reports on community health; can't measure if not same community
- Merit and different kinds of contributions
- Decision making
- Link to poisionous people video
- Brief list of corporate ways to contribute

# Training Our Team The Apache Way
## Alan Gates - 2016 ACEU keynote-apachebd-eu-nov-2016-161122152750.pptx 
http://www.slideshare.net/alanfgates/keynote-apache-bdeunov2016

Short but powerfully presented deck about Hortonworks' internal employee 
training on the Apache Way.  Internal one-hour training session; started 
with dev/prod mgmt but rolling out throughout company.

"Apache has ways to train new community members and new communities - e.g. the Incubator"

Apache Way; license; why company chose to work this way;
how to be employee & committer both; trademarks

Great distillation of Apache Way messages in context of employee teams.

# Writing And Distributing Software The Apache Way
## Justin Erenkrantz 2010-Other OSBC - No Jerks Allowed2010.pdf
http://www.erenkrantz.com/apachecon/OSBC%20-%20No%20Jerks%20Allowed.pdf

- Historical perspective
- PMCS are separate merit structures
- Voting, communication and consensus techniques
- Define many terms (was still early days then)
- "No jerks allowed" - key early messsage
  - FOSS communities value group contributors, not lone wolves
  -
