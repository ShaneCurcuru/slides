At OSCON Ignite, I had 5 minutes for 20 slides to explain why an open source project's brand is more important than your code.

### Abstract

BRAND > CODE - a controversial statement to be sure.  But how useful is your code if no-one else ever uses it - or contributes to it?

Spend 5 minutes with Shane Igniting the story about how brand can bring more project growth and longevity to your project than the code itself does.  Ensuring you can tell the **story** of your project and what it does to the world is the best way to attract new contributors.

*Also, apologies.*  Unfortunately the conference video system mangled my beautiful slides; and it was a rough day for me - I don't normally say "so" that many times (not sure what I was thinking!)
