### Abstract

Want to find new ways to draw in contributors to your project? Looking to attract ideas and attention from some of the corporate vendors, but don't want to lose your independence? Don't know how to approach your employer's plans to launch BigCo's SuperLucene product? 

Learn how to improve your project's brand, drawing in newcomers as productive contributors, and defending your brand from aggressive vendors. Dealing fairly and firmly with companies mis-using your good reputation seems hard, but it doesn't need to be.  

Learn about what uses of Apache brands that are OK, versus infringing uses hungry vendors try to use - and how to stop them. The strong independent reputation of your project and Apache overall relies on every PMC policing their own brand effectively and fairly. The Trademarks Committee is here to help!

Simple ways to draw in more new contributors.

## Audience

Existing Apache project PMC members and committers, although any attendees interested in improving brands or better engaging your users will be interested. This will be a wholly revamped v5.0 of my previous similar talk based on past feedback and experience.
