The State of the Feather is an annual overview presentation explaining what the ASF is and how our operations have unfolded over the past year.

### Abstract

The State of the Feather covers the basic statistics about number of projects, committers, sponsors, and the like.  It also reviews any of the major Apache-wide changes or news from the past year.  It is given by an ASF Foundation leader each year at ApacheCon conferences.

In Fall 2015, the ASF had 8 platinum sponsors, 167 top level projects (with 43 podlings in the Incubator), well over 4,000 individual committers, and an annual budget of about USD 1 million.  We also sent about 1 billion emails during the year, served 13 million unique visitors weekly, from every UN recognized country in the world, plus a number of territories and other regions.
