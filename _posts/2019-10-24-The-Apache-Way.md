For ApacheCon Berlin 2019, I got great feedback and interaction with 
the audience - and some surprising questions too!

The Apache Way - Effective Open Source Project Management

### Abstract

The Apache Way is useful for organizations and individuals to be more 
effective at working in distributed communities.  Open source software does not 
necessarily mean open development - and true community-led open development 
is where the fun starts in working in FOSS!

There are a lot more aspects to consider and areas to invest in as 
you move forward through the open source journey.  These are just the 
starting points to work on.

A key reminder: open source works best when you're working with softare 
that you actually use.  Taking the time to choose which teams or 
projects that you open up or participate is well worth the investment to
keep your team's efforts focused.
