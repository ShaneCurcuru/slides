Many companies are built around Apache software; that's a big part of the contribution model for most ASF projects.  Making a profit is great; all Apache communities and projects want is the trademark credit they deserve for the work they do for free.

### Abstract

Does your company want to capitalize on the Apache brand?  Are you interested in seeing how closely you can tie your marketing into the latest Apache projects? Do you recognize the importance of supporting the Apache ecosystem, not just with code contributions but other actions?

As VP of Brand Management for all Apache projects, I can help show business and technical leaders some of the ways they can respectfully and successfully market and position their own services in relation to Apache project brands.  The key message is: Apache project governance is independent; but we are happy to have businesses build their software and services on any Apache software products.
