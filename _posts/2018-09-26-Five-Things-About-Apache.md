As an Apache Member regularly speaking at events, I get a lot of basic questions about Apache.  The documentation is out there - here are some great pointers to answers.

Five Things You Might Not Know About Apache

### Abstract

As a volunteer run organization, the how-to documentation about our corporate operations is not as easy to find as it should be.  As an foundation that hosts multiple, independent technologies and communities, it's not always obvious where to go for help.

In this 5 minute Lightning Talk at ApacheCon Montréal 2018, I answer five of the top questions I regularly get with a pointer to documentation that explains what it is, and why it's important.  Be sure to read the speaker notes and watch the video too!
