For ApacheCon Montréal 2018, I honed and updated my Apache Way slides to better focus on just the behaviors and techniques that attendees can take home with them to be more effective in their projects.

### Abstract

The Apache Way is useful for organizations and individuals to be more 
effective at working in distributed communities.  Open source does not 
necessarily mean open development - and true community-led open development 
is where the fun starts in working in FOSS!

There are a lot more aspects to consider and areas to invest in as 
you move forward through the open source journey.  These are just the 
starting points to work on.

A key reminder: open source works best when you're working with softare 
that you actually use.  Taking the time to choose which teams or 
projects that you open up or participate is well worth the investment to
keep your team's efforts focused.
