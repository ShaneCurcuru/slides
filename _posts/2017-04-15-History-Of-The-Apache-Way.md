title: History of the Apache Way
description: Learning from the history of the ASF and reviewing past slides
---

This is a brief history of some of the key Apache Way documents and presentations.  These have 
been presented by some amazing Apache committers and Members at 
ApacheCon and a variety of other open source conferences in the past 
15 years.  This is a curated selection of publicly posted slide decks, 
as well as pointers to official and unofficial resources.

Note that in the past, these talks were often an overview of history 
and how the ASF is organized, along with touching on the behavioral 
and community aspects of the Apache Way.  For a time, they were a common 
main track presentation at the start of ApacheCon.

The Apache Way slot at ApacheCon morphed over time into the "State of the Feather",
which is now given by an officer of the ASF.  It is more of a snapshot about 
the health of the ASF as an organization - not just it's component projects,
but the corporation and operations that keep the servers running and 
the press releases and tweets and events coming too.

So, too, morphs the Apache Way talk of today, focusing much more on the 
behaviors and practices that are core to running a successful and 
diverse community-led project.

## Past Presentations About The Apache Way

### [Inner Source And The Apache Wy](https://www.slideshare.net/jimjag/innersource-101-and-the-apache-way) 
#### Jim Jagielski - InnerSource Commons 2017

This is an advanced talk using the aspects of the Apache Way to lead 
corporate developers and managers how to use [InnerSource](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/) - taking 
open source / open development concepts for use inside the firewall and 
inside corporate development teams.

##### Top Aspects Covered

- Meritocracy
- Peer-based
- Consensus decision making 
- Collaborative development 
- Responsible oversight
- Individual participation

##### Quotable Bits

- Focus on community
- Focus on the un-aligned volunteer contributor

- Since we are all volunteers, people’s time and interests change
- A healthy community is “warm and inviting” and encourages a continued influx of developers
- Poisonous people/communities turn people off, and the project will die

- Open and asynchronous
- Doesn’t disenfranchise anyone
- Maintains history and allows ebb/flow of participants

- Transparency: You can only reuse what you can **see**

- Communities can create durable assets, processes and culture

- Merit: Technical decisions made by technical experts, with **earned** authority in that community

- A Community is not the same as a team: 
  - Self organizing
  - Self identifying
  - Working in own time frames


### [The Apache Way - Amalgamation](http://people.apache.org/~druggeri/presentations/TheApacheWay.odp)
#### Daniel Ruggeri - 2015 UMiss 

This is a new Apache Member's amalgamation of many past Apache Way 
slide decks, covering all the points in a detailed yet condensed way.

##### Quotable Bits

- "The board runs the foundation, not the projects"
- "The code is owned by the foundation" (but: really just licensed)
- "Community agrees on direction - (but) Individuals then make it happen"
- "Pragmatic and permissive - Maximum freedom for users"

##### Final slide

**The Apache way is**
- **Meritocracy** – those who do, decide
- **Participation** – by individuals with peer review
- **Oversight** – responsible and independent
- **Decisions** – made by consensus
- **Collaboration** – public and asynchronous


### [The Apache Way](http://home.apache.org/~nick/Talks/ApacheConNA15/TheApacheWay15.pdf) 
#### Nick Burch - ApacheCon North America 2015

This is a modern version of the early classic Apache Way talks, that 
emphasizes all the past people who helped create the content.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
Foundation has some common support (eg infra, press, trademarks), to help projects focus on their code and on their communities
</blockquote>

##### Top Aspects Covered

- History lesson
- Apache by the numbers & graphs
- Structure/governance of the ASF and projects
- Example: Jakarta & Umbrellas -> flattened, each project reports on community health; can't measure if not same community
- Merit and different kinds of contributions
- Decision making
- Link to [poisonous people video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F-3E8pyjFo) - and how to avoid them
- Brief list of ways corporations to contribute (different than as individuals)
- Problem areas at the ASF: Umbrella projects: who is responsible / who can evaluate the work or new contributors?

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">Merit does <b>not</b> buy you authority (community must still agree)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Merit gets you <b>privileges</b>: commit access, voting on committers</blockquote>


### [Training Our Team The Apache Way](http://www.slideshare.net/alanfgates/keynote-apache-bdeunov2016)
#### Alan Gates - ApacheCon Europe Keynote 2016

Short but powerfully presented deck about Hortonworks' internal employee 
training on the Apache Way.  Internal one-hour training session; started 
with developers & project management, but rolled out throughout company.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><p>Apache has ways to train new community members and new communities - like the Incubator</p></blockquote>

Key points: Apache Way; permissive license; why their company chose to work this way;
how to be both an employee and a committer on an Apache project; trademarks and proper use.  Great distillation of Apache Way messages in the context of a software company's employees and teams.

<blockquote><p>The fact that you’re a manager or an architect or a founder at our company doesn’t mean anything inside Apache communities</p></blockquote>

### [Writing And Distributing Software The Apache Way](http://www.erenkrantz.com/apachecon/OSBC%20-%20No%20Jerks%20Allowed.pdf)
#### Justin Erenkrantz - OSBC 2010

- Historical perspective
- PMCS are each separate merit structures
- Voting, communication and consensus techniques
- Defined many ASF terms (it was still the early days of explaining the Apache Way)
- "No jerks allowed" - a key early message in ASF community history
  - FOSS communities value group contributors, not lone wolves
  - Diverse communities that can attract new contributors over time are important
