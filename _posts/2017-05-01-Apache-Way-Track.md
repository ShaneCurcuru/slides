title: Apache Way Track
description: A full day of curated talks about the Apache Way
conference: ApacheCon Miami
feature: true

Working with other Apache committers and the ApacheCon planning committee,
I curated a full day of training sessions about the Apache Way, from all
different perspectives.  We had a half-dozen Apache Members and more committers 
writing completely new presentations, each covering the core behaviors 
in a unique and informative way.

Watching the other presentations during that day, I was amazed at how consistent 
the core messages were, even for speakers who had never done an Apache Way 
talk before.  But every presentation told a different story, covering 
aspects and reasons that made sense to them about what to do and why.
