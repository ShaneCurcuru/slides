# Shane's Open Source slides

A better place to write and store slide decks for the various open source
conferences that I speak at. Be sure to look for speaker notes!

## Technology

After years of using an office suite to craft slides using a custom template
for every conference, I'm switching to simple Markdown-written slides using
one of the modern browser-based JS slide tools.

Currently evaluating [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark),
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Conferences

I speak regularly at [ApacheCon and
Apache:BigData](http://apachecon.com/) on community and branding issues
around Apache projects. I've also spoken at OSCON, Ignite, Camel One,
and the Software Freedom Law Conference.
