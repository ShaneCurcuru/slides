# Shane's Open Source slides

A better place to write and store slide decks for the various open source
conferences that I speak at. Be sure to look for speaker notes!

## Technology

After years of using an office suite to craft slides using a custom template
for every conference, I'm switching to simple Markdown-written slides using
one of the modern browser-based JS slide tools.

Currently evaluating [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark),
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Conferences

I speak regularly at [ApacheCon and
Apache:BigData](http://apachecon.com/) on community and branding issues
around Apache projects. I've also spoken at OSCON, Ignite, Camel One,
and the Software Freedom Law Conference.

## About Shane

Shane serves as Vice President of [Brand Management for the
ASF](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources), setting policy
for trademarks and branding across all 200+ Apache projects and
podlings, and has served as six-time Director. Shane regularly talks
and blogs about branding and governance issues for open source projects.
In the mundane world, Shane has worked in the past at Lotus and IBM as an
Application Architect. Otherwise, Shane is: a father and husband, a
Member of the ASF, a baker, a BMW driver and punny guy. Oh, and we have
[cats][1].
