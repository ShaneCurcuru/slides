**From dev@to user@** with Steve: How projects need to make it easy to attract new contributors

**Panel on Software is easy, people are hard** Panel discussion with Benjamin and Apache experts - how Apache projects can survive where others get dominated by one company, or run out of ideas and volunteers and disappear.

**Bring your Project To The Incubator** with Nick: How your company can plan for bringing your project to the incubator - successfully.

**Committed to Apache** with Sharan: How individuals can get recognized for contributions in other ways **besides code**

# Apache Way
## Defining The Behaviors


---
template: logorb
# Apache Way History

- Growth of the ASF
- Creation of PMCs
- History of the Apache Way

---
template: logorb
# What we AREN'T Talking About

- But I'm not going to do that
- What does history matter now?
- Why do we care how or why it happened?

???
We often talk about the history of the Apache Group and how the founders 
incorporated the ASF, and grew the first few projects.

But is that really important?  You want to learn the behaviors, right?
Actionable information.

But in a diverse and dispersed world, having the why behind the rule - 
or the rationale to the policy - is a key way to ensure the community 
can understand it, know it's proven value, and then have an intelligent 
and focused way that we could work on changes.

# Community

.footnote[
[Take a different way?](#menu)
]

---
template: logorb
# Community

- Not talking about Community
- How does it actually measure compared to your community?
- We don't live together
- we don't work together
- We don't know each other
- Except through the project

"It's not a hierachy, it's a community"

---
template: logorb
# Community - No Jerks Allowed

- "No jerks allowed" - a key early message
  - FOSS communities value group contributors, not lone wolves
  - Diverse communities that can attract new contributors over time

**Be Excellent To Each Other**

---
template: logorb
# Community - Wear Your Hats

- Hats - individuals, not affiliations (or employers)
- No corporate participation
- Individuals get recognition
  - Side effect for corporate teams: all team members must participate for value

---
template: logorb
# Community - Affiliations At The Door

- Not talking about hierarchy
- Because we have one - each project separate
- each volunteer with same powers (and superpowers in PMC)

---
template: logorb
# Community - Independent Governance

- Community owns the brand
- ASF owns the trademarks
- ASF ensures neutrality, open development
- PMCs are required to behave independently


---
template: pineapple
name: merit
# Merit

.footnote[
[Take a different way?](#menu)
]

---
template: logorb
# Merit - What YOU Can Do

- Not talking about meritocracy
- Do-ocracy
- Growth in ability to contribute/change things:
User
Contributor
Committer
PMC Member
PMC Chair / VP
ASF Member
Corporate VP
Director

"You gain merit by doing things the community values"

Problem areas: Umbrella projects: who is responsible / who can evaluate the work or new contributors?  Merit is within each separate community.

"Merit does not buy you authority (community must still agree)"
"Merit gets you privileges: commit access, voting on committers"

"- Leaders vs. managers."

# Open Development

.footnote[
[Take a different way?](#menu)
]

---
template: logorb
# Open Development - Time Shifting

- Not talking asynchronously
- because that would be silly
- But it's critical for ... a dispersed project
- ...dispersed in space
- ...dispersed in abilities / expertise
- ...dispersed in motivation
- dispersed in time
- only know each other through project

---
template: logorb
# Open Development - Archiving Everything

- If It Didn't Happen On-List It Didn't Happen
- Must be public list unless there's a reason
- Provide time for feedback, critique, new ideas, other people to chime in or show their work

---
template: logorb
# Open Development - Transparent Decisions

- Not talking about transparency
- Your motives aren't transparent to the community
  - Motivated by boss, by outside technical need, by just being a geek
- Motivation should be best for project as a whole

---
template: logorb
# Pragmatic License

- Apache License
- Maximum user freedom
- Trust in ASF as corporation to maintain open development using it

---
template: beachbottom
name: decision
# Decision Making

.footnote[
[Take a different way?](#menu)
]

---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - Consensus Preferred

- Consensus within community
- Choose best path forward
- Or even an improvement
  - Your perfection may be someone else's "meh"

---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - Votes When Needed

- Not talking about voting
  - Because it's really consensus we're looking for
- Voting just a shortcut to help move consensus forward in a timely manner


---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - Timeline

- **Minimum** time to make a decision: 72 hours
- Allows timeshifted input from community

---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - No Deadlines

- Not talking about deadlines
- Because **we** don't have any - besides those **we** agree on together
- Because our deadlines are "earliest date" something can happen


---
template: treeright
name: communication
# Communication

.footnote[
[Take a different way?](#menu)
]

---
template: logorb
# Community-Wide Communication

- Not talking about english
- Because... translation software isn't social
