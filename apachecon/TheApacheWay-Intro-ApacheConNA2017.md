# Apache Way
## Defining The Behaviors


---
template: logorb
# Apache Way History

- Growth of the ASF
- Creation of PMCs
- History of the Apache Way

---
template: logorb
# What we AREN'T Talking About

- But I'm not going to do that
- What does history matter now?
- Why do we care how or why it happened?

???
We often talk about the history of the Apache Group and how the founders 
incorporated the ASF, and grew the first few projects.

But is that really important?  You want to learn the behaviors, right?
Actionable information.

But in a diverse and dispersed world, having the why behind the rule - 
or the rationale to the policy - is a key way to ensure the community 
can understand it, know it's proven value, and then have an intelligent 
and focused way that we could work on changes.

---
template: logorb
# Community

- Not talking about Community
- How does it actually measure compared to your community?
- We don't live together
- we don't work together
- We don't know each other
- Except through the project

---
template: logorb
# Meritocracy

- Not talking about meritocracy
- Do-ocracy
- Growth in ability to contribute/change things:
User
Contributor
Committer
PMC Member
PMC Chair / VP
ASF Member
Corporate VP
Director

--
template: logorb
# Affiliations At The Door

- Not talking about hierarchy
- Because we have one - each project separate
- each volunteer with same powers (and superpowers in PMC)

---
template: logorb
# Open Development - Time Shifting

- Not talking asynchronously
- because that would be silly
- But it's critical for ... a dispersed project
- ...dispersed in space
- ...dispersed in abilities / expertise
- ...dispersed in motivation
- dispersed in time
- only know each other through project

---
template: logorb
# Open Development - Archiving Everything

- If It Didn't Happen On-List It Didn't Happen
- Must be public list unless there's a reason
- Provide time for feedback, critique, new ideas, other people to chime in or show their work

---
template: logorb
# Transparency In Decisions

- Not talking about transparency
- Your motives aren't transparent to the community
  - Motivated by boss, by outside technical need, by just being a geek
- Motivation should be best for project as a whole

---
template: logorb
# Pragmatic License

- Apache License
- Maximum user freedom
- Trust in ASF as corporation to maintain open development using it

---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - Only When Needed

- Not talking about voting
  - Because it's really consensus we're looking for
- Voting just a shortcut to help move consensus forward in a timely manner

---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - Preferred Method

- Consensus within community
- Choose best path forward
- Or even an improvement
  - Your perfection may be someone else's "meh"

---
template: logorb
# Decision Making - Timeline

- **Minimum** time to make a decision: 72 hours
- Allows timeshifted input from community

--
template: logorb
# Deadlines - Only Yours

- Not talking about deadlines
- Because **we** don't have any - besides those **we** agree on together
- Because our deadlines are "earliest date" something can happen

--
template: logorb
# Affiliations At The Door

- Hats - individuals, not affiliations (or employers)
- No corporate participation
- Individuals get recognition
  - Side effect for corporate teams: all team members must participate for value

--
template: logorb
# Community-Wide Communication

- Not talking about english
- Because... translation software isn't social

--
template: logorb
# Project Independence

- Community owns the brand
- ASF owns the trademarks
- ASF ensures neutrality, open development
- PMCs are required to behave independently
