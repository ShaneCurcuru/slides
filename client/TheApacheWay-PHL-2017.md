# The Apache Way

> Behaviors and practices developed by 100's of projects at the ASF

> Designed to promote long-lived successful projects

> Focus on stable, independent governance and encouraging new contributors

???
This is a brief overview to the comprehensive set of behaviors 
and best practices developed over many years and hundreds 
of projects at the ASF.

# The Apache Way

> Behaviors and practices developed by 100's of projects at the ASF

> Designed to promote long-lived successful projects

> Focus on stable, independent governance and encouraging new contributors

> **Required behaviors for Apache projects!**

???
These behaviors are **required** of Apache projects - but they will be 
useful in any distributed project.


---
template: logorb
# Apache Way History

- Creation of the ASF as a Foundation
  - Provides independent oversight
- PMCs provide project governance
  - Experience across community styles
  - Effective in multiple industries

???
The behaviors of the Apache Way can be used by anyone, but are born 
out of extensive experience governing the 100's of Apache Software 
Foundation projects ranging from high performance big data streaming 
tools to end user applications and everything in between.

Having an independent board overseeing all 
Apache PMCs ensures that governance stays independent; and having each 
PMC be in charge of their project as a whole keeps the focus on 
all users of the software.


---
template: logorb
# Skip The History!

- Long history of the Apache Way
- Many painful lessons learned
- Improvements from many sources
- Copied by other foundations
  - **What Can I Do Now?**

???
But is that really important?  You want to learn the behaviors, right?
Actionable information.  Let's get to the good stuff - the behaviors 
that have worked well for 100's of Apache projects, and have been copied across the industry.

But in a diverse and dispersed world, having the **why** behind the rule - 
or the **rationale** to the policy - is a key way to ensure the community 
can understand it, know it's proven value, and then have an intelligent 
and focused way that we could work on changes.  That's still there - but 
we'll save the whys for after we talk about the whats.

# Apache Way
## Defining The Behaviors

# Apache Way: Menu

What do **you** want to talk about next?

- **[Community](#community)**   _- over Code_
- **[Merit](#merit)**     _- recognizing your work_
- **[Open Development](#open)**  _- for **everything**_
- **[Decision Making](#decision)**  _- consensus & votes_
- **[Communication](#communication)**  _- how we write_
- **[Comcast To-Dos](#client)**  _- what **you** can do_

???
Community Over Code also means that You Need To Participate.

Each of these is a set of topics about a kind of behaviors that 
Apache projects are expected to follow.

- What kind of community do we mean?
  - We don't live together
  - We don't work together
  - We don't know each other
- _Except_ through our project

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
What does community mean here?  Working on an independent open source 
project is very different than most other human activities.  There are 
no other ties between people widely distributed in location, in time, 
in experience, and in jobs besides the project itself.

# Community

- What kind of community do we mean?
  - We don't live together
  - We don't work together
  - We don't know each other
- _Except_ through our project
- Community includes developers, writers, testers, sysadmins, 
devops... **and users**

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
The important thing is that the **community** owns the project.  Not you, 
not me, not your company.  All of us.

Importantly, users are not necessarily customers.  The ways that you may
be used to connecting with customers is different than effective ways 
to communicate and get feedback from other users of the product.

# No Jerks Allowed

- "No jerks allowed" - a key early message
  - We value group contributors, not lone wolves
  - Diverse communities attract new contributors
  - BDFL not allowed in Apache communities

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
There are many ways to say this - No Jerks Allowed, Avoid Poisonous 
People, be decent, whatever.  The point is, where everyone is a volunteer 
and most people are doing this as a side task or second effort, ensuring 
that everyone is welcome is the most important factor for a long-lived 
health project.

# No Jerks Allowed

- "No jerks allowed" - a key early message
  - We value group contributors, not lone wolves
  - Diverse communities attract new contributors
  - BDFL not allowed in Apache communities

### Be Excellent To Each Other

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
In the immortal words of Bill and Ted: Be Excellent To Each Other.

This is important for any community, and doubly so for Apache projects, 
since we're all also part of the larger ASF community.  We have a code 
of conduct - not because we want to use it, but because we don't want 
to have to use it, since the great majority of our communities keep 
discussion polite to start with. 

Remember: your community doesn't work for you.  It needs to be to their
advantage to contribute to the project too - either in code, or docs, 
or answering questions on the mailing list. 


---
template: logorb
# Wear Your Hats

- You are an individual - not an employee
- No corporate participation at Apache
- Individuals get recognition
  - Side effect for corporate teams: all team members participate _separately_
  - Side effect for **you**: your merit stays with **you**

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
The ASF does not allow direct corporate participation in projects.  
We only recognize individuals.  Merit accrues to individuals, and they 
are expected to act for the best interests of the project as a whole.

This may be a polite fiction - many employment agreements mean you have 
to look out for your employer first - but it's a key part of how our projects work.

This both ensures that newcomers - from big employers or small ones - are 
welcome in our projects, and also means that the merit **you** gain 
in an Apache project stays with **you**, no matter where you work.  That 
helps encourage long-lived participants, across jobs.


---

template: logorb
# Check Affiliations At The Door

- FOSS communities don't have employees
- Act as individuals
- Volunteers all have same powers

### Apache PMCs don't care what your dayjob role is

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
Wearing your project hat means you're acting on behalf of the project as 
a whole, not your employer.  Sometimes you need to do things as an 
employee; that's fine.  But mark it clearly, and when voting on 
serious project decisions, wear your project hat.


---
template: logorb
# Independent Governance

- ASF owns all trademarks
  - ASF ensures neutrality, open development
- PMC owns project brand
  - PMCs govern independently

> "It's not a hierachy, it's a community"

.footnote[
**Community**
]

???
The net effect of all the above is that projects are governed for the 
public good and the best interests of the project community as a whole.

PMCs are expected to make releases and vote in new committers based on 
merit - how much an individual creates value for that project.

When PMCs slack in their duties, the board is here to provide oversight 
and if necessary, correction.  Both at the PMC level and the board level 
we expect people to act for the public good - and the fact we are a 
501C3 organization, with directors elected from merit - not sponsor 
dollars - means we can back it up.

# Merit

.footnote[

template: logorb
# What You Can Do

> Defined by the value **you** bring to a project

> In the **context of that project** by the project community

> "You gain merit by doing things that a specific community values"

.footnote[
**Merit**
]

???
Meritocracy is a word we use that is often misunderstood - some other 
communities see it as having a different connotation than the ASF uses.

Your merit is the value you bring to a project **as judged by that project's community**.

Every project is it's own merit structure.  Merit is not transferable, 
and it doesn't expire.  It may get stale, but it stays with you through 
jobs and careers.


---
template: logorb
# Growth In Ability

The more you do, the more power you _may be granted_ to take actions:
- User
- Contributor
  - **Committer**
  - **PMC Member**
  - PMC Chair / VP
- ASF Member
  - **Director**

.footnote[
**Merit**
]

???
Each step is defined by the merit you are recognized for by that 
specific community. Each step means you can get a binding vote on new tasks.

While all committers can directly checkin code to their project(s), 
PMC members can also vote on new committers and on product releases.

ASF Members don't have any extra abilities with projects; however they 
can vote for the board of directors.   Directors don't directly affect 
project technical direction, but do appoint corporate officers, and do 
provide social and organizational oversight to all Apache projects.


---
template: logorb
# Not Authority

- Leaders vs. managers

> "Merit does not buy you **authority**: community must still agree"

> "Merit gets you **privileges**: commit access, votes on committers"

.footnote[
**Merit**
]

???
You are still part of the community - it's not a hierarchy; everyone 
with merit (commit bit) has a say in basic decisions.

Everyone can propose and do new work.  Just because you might not find some 
new work valuable doesn't mean some other part of the community doesn't 
value the new work.  Any vetoes (in the rare cases they are allowed) must 
have a technical justification.


---
template: logorb
# Umbrella Projects

## Problem area!

Apache Jakarta was an umbrella project - with many different subprojects and 
components - _and communities_.

The PMC must be a _coherent_ community to be able to **recognize merit** in all contributors.


.footnote[
**Merit**
]

???
A cautionary tale: in the past, we have had successful projects that grew 
in scope - both technical and social - until they were too big to 
govern themselves effectively - either socially or technically.

When a project grows such that different groups of committers running 
modules can't evaluate each other's work - or vote on releases - it's 
probably too big.

The board is here to backstop communities.  Each community needs to be 
coherent and work as a single unit - when you're bigger than that, you should 
split up into separate projects.

# Time Shifting

- **Asynchronous** communication is critical
  - ...dispersed in space
  - ...dispersed in abilities / expertise
  - ...dispersed in motivation
  - ...dispersed in time

.footnote[
**Open Development**
]

???
Yes, we use mailing lists!

Remember: we are a dispersed community, each with our own lives and jobs.
We need to show the work we're doing - and allow feedback - in whatever 
timeframe works for everyone else on the project.  In many cases the 
only connection community members have to each other is through the 
code itself - and the mailing lists.

You don't need to wait for everyone's feedback - but you do need to recognize that 
sometimes other committers will have better ideas, or will be willing 
to do some of the work for you.

This is doubly important when your **team** works in open source: remember,
the rest of the community isn't around the coffeemaker in your office!
Bring your discussions back to the list!


---
template: logorb
# Archive Everything

> If It Didn't Happen On-List It Didn't Happen

- Must be public list unless there's a reason
- Asynchronous lists provide time for
  - Feedback
  - New ideas
  - Others to show _their_ work

> Allows newcomers to learn at any time

.footnote[
**Open Development**
]

???
Archiving everything means that newcomers can get up to speed with 
all the information of the project available for them.  Even if your 
documentation doesn't lead new users through this, having it available 
both for people to find, and especially for people to reference when 
questions come up is the most important thing.

This means that IRC, Slack, Hipchat, and the like must bring any 
interesting conversations back to the mailing list, so that the rest of 
the community can participate in any **decisions**.

# Project Motivation

- Your motives aren't transparent to the community
  - Motivated by your boss, by outside technical need, by just being a geek

- New work should be done for benefit of project as a whole


.footnote[
**Open Development**
]

???
Ensuring decisions are made openly - when everyone has the same information 
and time to read it - is required of Apache projects.  This is a key area 
where "corporate open source" falls short, and doesn't truly practice 
"open development".

**Open source does not always mean open development.**

Apache projects **always** practice open development - it's required.

---
template: logorb
# Transparent Decisions

The best way to work is to:

1. Telegraph your intent
2. Draft designs openly
3. Submit work in chunks
4. Welcome feedback along the way

.footnote[
**Open Development**
]

???
Ensuring the community has enough information on the work being done and 
coming up soon is important for open development.  Just dumping complete 
code prevents others from adding their expertise or ideas - some of which 
may lead to better code than you've developed alone.

The best way to get something done well in open source is either to do 
**everything** yourself, or to implement something half-way - and wait 
to see how the rest of the community will improve your code.

---
template: logorb
# Pragmatic License

- Apache License v2.0
- Maximum user freedom
- Trust in ASF as corporation
  - To maintain open development
  - To continue to provide source code

> Apache Attic - where quiet projects slumber

.footnote[
**Open Development**
]

???
A goal of the ASF is to encourage maximum inbound contributions.
Using the broadly permissive Apache License v2.0 is a key part of 
this - both from the legal details point of view, and from our brand.

People trust they can just use stuff from Apache without being surprised 
by any unusual licenses or changes.

Stick with standard licenses, CLAs.  **Don't customize** - customizations, 
no matter how much your lawyers want them - scare off new contributors.

# Decision Making

.footnote[
[_Take a different way?_](#menu) | _Continue On: Decision Making_
]


---
template: logorb
# Consensus Preferred

- Consensus within community
- Choose best path forward
  - Or even an improvement
  - Your perfection may be someone else's "meh"


.footnote[
**Decision Making**
]

???
**There is no perfection** - just getting better step by step.  Our goal is 
to serve the public good, so any new features - as long as they don't 
fail the tests or unduly slow down performance - is a good thing.

Consensus doesn't mean everyone thinks it's perfect - just that any 
proposed change is better somehow than we have now.


.footnote[
**Decision Making**
]

---
template: logorb
# Vote Only When Needed

> "Voting is a shortcut to move consensus forward in a timely manner"

> "Voting is a way to record an official consensus"


.footnote[
**Decision Making**
]

???
**Here are two quotes about voting** - the +1/-1 you've all heard about.
One of these is a good use of voting, the other is... not as good.

You must vote on releases.  In some cases, the vote is the formal 
record that a PMC or the board made a decision.  That keeps the decision 
as being an act of the ASF as a foundation, and not just a bunch of 
individual developers.

Voting to speed consensus... it can be OK in some cases, but where possible 
we prefer to work through to a better consensus. Some projects choose as 
a whole community to use votes more often, but it's not required.


---
template: logorb
# Timelines

- **Minimum** time to make a decision: 72 hours


- Allows timeshifted input from community


.footnote[
**Decision Making**
]

???
Your project community is from around the world, and from all sorts of 
backgrounds.  For example, some people commit during a dayjob; some people 
only have time on weekends or when the kids are asleep.

Ensuring sufficient time for most community members to comment is 
required for many major decisions in Apache projects.  Note: not needed
on every change, just significant code changes, releases, or the like.

---
template: logorb
# Deadlines

- Because **we** don't have any - besides those **we** agree on together


- Because our deadlines are "earliest date" something can happen


.footnote[
**Decision Making**
]

???
The ASF relies on volunteers (from the Apache perspective) to do our 
work.  Therefore in project areas, we don't have deadlines, other
than ones the project defines as a community.

If you truly follow open development, you need to allow for input from 
the rest of the community.  This isn't to say a few developers can't 
make progress and even cut a release - but the community may still come 
along later to make changes.

One exception: security fixes, which must be done responsibly and quickly.

**Communication**
]

???
You can't overemphasize this message!

We all come from different backgrounds, and email loses all the social 
hints at behavior that we are used to in real life.  Assume the best 
of people, and when upset more than ever, write your email but 
**don't send it**.  Give it time.  Unless it's a security issue or 
a release vote, the community can take the time to defuse poor 
behavior.

# Code Of Conduct

- Don't allow poisonous behavior to go unaddressed

**ASF Code of Conduct**

https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct

.footnote[
**Communication**
]

???
This is how we operate, in all Apache project and foundation spaces.

FOSS projects and foundations without a code of conduct will not 
attract as many contributions as ones with a healthy and friendly community.

See the recent GitHub Developer's survey, which showed a large majority 
of developers - of every background - believed that encouraging diverse 
contributors was an important thing for projects.

# Language

> "Core **development** activity must be in English."

- Translation software isn't social
- Whole community must be able to evaluate all project work
- ASF Board provides oversight to all communities

.footnote[
**Communication**
]

???
At the current time, it's only practical for the ASF to provide 
governance and hosting to communities that can operate their dev@ 
list in English.  

This doesn't mean it can't be done - it certainly is being done in China
and elsewhere - just that the ASF can't support non-english as the 
primary **development** language.

So what can **you** do as an organization to improve your open source work?

---
template: logorb
# Corporate Policies

- Simple contribution policies for FOSS work
- Use OSI-approved licenses (Apache or GPL)
- Provide non-developer resources to FOSS projects


.footnote.small[
Comcast - What You Can Do
]

???
**Big takeaway:** ensure employees aren't blocked from working in open 
source - either by legal, management, or worries about IP risk.

If you bring a project to the ASF, plan ahead for branding, community, 
and leadership issues in the project, and expect the Incubation process.

If you have changes to an existing project, then submit them in an 
open and iterative fashion, and work with the existing project community.

FOSS foundations want to see your employees engaged in open source.

# Project Planning

- Be honest about open source vs. open development
- Consider architecture choices in FOSS
  - Easy to understand modules
  - Functionality useful for others
  - Highly customized features: keep internal

.footnote.small[
Comcast - What You Can Do
]

???
"Recognise that your project isn't necessarily about **your** needs - but 
plan a project that is valuable to many people - and you have a much better 
chance of building a vibrant community."  - @VMBrasseur

Open sourcing an internal tool is easy.  Attracting a community and getting 
the benefits of open development take work, and take some time to allow 
community to grow.  Planning the architecture and how the staff treat 
users and contributors is key to attracting good contributions.

Have a CONTRIBUTING.md policy - and make sure you task developers 
to review pull requests or bug reports.  Even if you don't accept 
some code patch, providing feedback to the submitter goes a long way.


---
template: logorb
# Employee Growth

- Encourage employees to work in open source
- Introduce InnerSource concepts across teams
- Recognize existing FOSS contributors


.footnote.small[
Comcast - What You Can Do
]

???
Top talent expects to be able to work on open soruce - whether as part 
of their dayjob project work, or on the side.  Ensure employees are 
encouraged to responsibly contribute, and have a culture of submitting 
fixes upstream.

Ensuring the management culture is fully accepting of open source 
behaviors goes a long way to getting employees comfortable with it.

InnerSource is a great re-framing of The Apache Way that is valuable 
to get experience internally, without the license complications, and 
gives employees the "Ah-ha" moments about sharing maintenance costs 
and un-duplicating work on purely internal projects.
