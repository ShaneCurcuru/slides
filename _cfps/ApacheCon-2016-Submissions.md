# ATO 2017 - Bio / Submission
Shane has been involved at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) since 1999, and serves as Director and VP of Brand Management, setting trademark policies and helping all 200+ Apache projects implement and defend their brands.

Otherwise, Shane is: a father and husband, a friend, a geek, a Member of the ASF, a baker, and a punny guy. Oh, and we have cats.  Shane blogs at http://communityovercode.com/ and regularly speaks on FOSS governance and branding topics.

Looking for an open source leadership engagement with a permissively licensed non-profit.

### Trademarks Demystified For FOSS Projects

Looking for ways to capitalize on the emerging FOSS brands that are driving innovation? Want to “make a new open source community” for your product, but not sure how to control the trademarks? Wondering if you should let the marketing team run with the great new brand campaign, or if you need to ask the lawyers about trademarks first?

Come learn the *practical* side of trademark law as it applies to software and open source alike. Contrary to the dire warnings your IP counsel gives you about them, trademark basics are actually pretty simple. In the fast moving software world, most trademark use or policing questions are business decisions, not legal ones – at least when it comes to open source projects.

Understanding how to respect the trademarks for the open source projects you rely on gains you credibility in the technical ecosystem. Politely policing your own marks, and having a practical policy up front for your own projects will save extra work and your reputation down the line.

Come learn from Shane’s years of experience teaching Apache software communities what trademarks really are, and how they work in the open source world. You’ll have the tools to make trademark creation, use, and policing for problems much easier on yourself, with less time and worry dealing with counsel.

### Successfully Profiting From Apache Projects (And Brands)

Shane serves as Vice President of Brand Management for the ASF, setting policy for trademarks and branding across all 200+ Apache projects, and is serving his fifth term as Director. Shane regularly talks and blogs about branding and governance issues for open source projects, and is looking for more ways to help companies and independent open source communities work productively together. Otherwise, Shane is: a father and husband, a Member of the ASF, a baker, an ex-Loti and current IBM'er, a BMW driver and punny guy. Oh, and we have cats. I blog at http://communityovercode.com

Does your company want to capitalize on Apache project brand? Are you interested in seeing how closely you can tie your marketing into the latest Apache projects, and gain a competitive advantage? Do you recognize the importance of supporting the Apache ecosystem, not just with code contributions but other actions? 

As VP of Brand Management for all Apache projects, I'll help show you how your company can successfully profit and "partner" with Apache projects. Apache is happy for you to make a profit off of our software in all sorts of ways - as long as you give credit to our volunteer-led and independent project communities. You may even incorporate Apache brands within your brands, but in specific ways that still give our communities credit. And if you're interested in having more influence over the technology, we have tips for how to contribute to Apache projects in all sorts of ways. We're here to help!

**Audience**

Business and technical leaders looking to influence and capitalize the work in Apache projects, on either a technical or marketing level. Key takeaway: how your business can capitalize on Apache project brands like Hadoop and Spark while still partnering successfully with open source projects and other vendors.

### Keeping your Apache Project's Independence and Brand

Shane serves as Vice President of Brand Management for the ASF, setting policy for trademarks and branding across all 200+ Apache projects, and is serving his fifth term as Director. Shane regularly talks and blogs about branding and governance issues for open source projects, and is looking for more ways to help companies and independent open source communities work productively together.

**Abstract**

Want to find new ways to draw in contributors to your project? Looking to attract ideas and attention from some of the corporate vendors, but don't want to lose your independence? Don't know how to approach your employer's plans to launch BigCo's SuperLucene product? 

Learn how to improve your project's brand, drawing in newcomers as productive contributors, and defending your brand from aggressive vendors. Dealing fairly and firmly with companies mis-using your good reputation seems hard, but it doesn't need to be.  

Learn about what uses of Apache brands that are OK, versus infringing uses hungry vendors try to use - and how to stop them. The strong independent reputation of your project and Apache overall relies on every PMC policing their own brand effectively and fairly. The Trademarks Committee is here to help!

**Audience**

Existing Apache project PMC members and committers, although any attendees following branding issues will be interested. This will be a wholly revamped v5.0 of my previous talk, and should be in the Community or People tracks.
