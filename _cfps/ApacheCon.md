## The Apache Way - Effective Open Source Project Management 

The Apache Way is a set of behaviors and techniques that anyone - organizations and individuals alike - can use to be more effective at working in distributed communities.  Open source does not necessarily mean open development - and true community-led open development 
is where the fun starts when working in FOSS!

This is an interactive review of the core behaviors used by Apache projects to help them stay healthy and productive over the long term.  While these behaviors are often required at the ASF, they are valuable to any collaborative project where the contributors are distributed across companies, continents, and experiences.

Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of practical actions they can take to help improve their own open source experience, and how to help their communities succeed together.
