[OSCON 2018 CFP](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/cfp/615)

_(From the OSCON Site)_ It’s a 20th anniversary celebration this year at OSCON, the longest running conference with open source as the central theme. And as you’ve come to expect, we are making some adjustments that continue to focus OSCON on how open source is a catalyst for innovation and transformation. Each and every track has been selected because of its open source nature and the significant change it presents to software development. Some of the trends we are going to be highlighting are AI, evolutionary architecture, blockchain, the SMACK stack, emerging languages such as Go, Kotlin, and Rust, cloud technologies like AWS, Azure, GCP, and edge computing.
